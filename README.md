# PACApp
PA Certification practice test application

Java application created as part of a software engineering class in which agile development was used to plan, design and create the program's
functionality. Scrum methodology was used in order to complete bi-weekly sprints (4 total sprints of 2 weeks each).

The application is designed to be used as a practice tool for physician assistant students that are preparing for the certification test.
Within the app, a user can create an account, take timed multiple choice tests, and review their past tests and scores. The data is saved
locally, allowing them to login later and still have access to all of their past attempts.

In the repository is a distributable .zip file that can be run after downloading and then opening the project.jar file. (Requires the JRE/Java Runtime Environment to be installed)

This project was originally worked on through GitLab, however due to myself switching over to using GitHub I re-uploaded it here.
